# Usage

There are three buttons in navbar. `Fetch and get` button will fetch data from public url, save it in local mysql database and then send the data to frontend. `Get` button will only retrive data from mysql database. (Database can be empty). `Clear` button delete all data from database. User can click on each exchange rate and get more detailed info about it.
